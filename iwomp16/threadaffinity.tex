Besides oversubscribing computational resources (hardware cores) by an OpenMP program, 
memory and thread affinity are another kinds of resources that should be coordinately allocated and managed among
multiple parallel runtimes. %about how resources are utilized. 
Thread affinity conflict happens when an OpenMP runtime binds threads data to 
certain memory places (cache or NUMA region) that are already occupied by 
the affinity requests of another runtime. Such overlaps cause excessive cache or memory spills or relocation of data
to further places, resulting increased memory access latency because of false sharing or 
poor locality of thread and its data. %the places.
The affinity conflicts can happen even the total number of threads requested does not exceed the number of hardware threads available.
%Obviously, conflicting thread affinity may adversely impact the performance of programs involved.
