Often a parallel machine is shared by users running multiple programs at the same time.
It is very likly that multiple OpenMP programs coexist within the same computation node. 
Current, an OpenMP implementation assumes that it fully occupies the entire computation node,
without considering the possibility of existence of other running OpenMP programs. 
This can cause problems such as resource contention and oversubscription.

Ideally, each running OpenMP program should register its resource utilizations with a node-wide registry.
Then another OpenMP program can query the registry and decide its own resource utilization strategy accordingly.
