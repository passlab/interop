%\TODO{Introduction mentions interoperability between two OpenMP runtimes. But this section does not mention this. That is part of use case #2}
In this section, we describe three use cases of interoperating OpenMP with other parallel system
and discuss the interoperability challenge of OpenMP.
%We then discuss the interoperability challenge, the limitations of the current standard to support 
%interoperability, and the motivation of this work. 
%as part of OpenMP Interoperability Subcommittee. 
%CPU oversubscription and affinity confliction are the two major performance challenges we identified when multiple parallel libraries do not interoperate well with each other. 
\subsection{Three Use Cases} % of OpenMP Interoperability}

In cases where OpenMP is coexisting with at least one other threading model,
we can identify at least three classes of scenarios in which to consider
interoperability: Phased, Concurrent and Nested.
These are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:interop-motif}.
Threaded applications that call threaded libraries from a sequential region
are a good example of the Phased motif.
The thread(s) inside of e.g. an MPI library used by an OpenMP application
matches with the Concurrent motif.
Nested can be either OpenMP threads calling application or library
functions that use another threading model, or the other way around.
Of course, in all cases, the coexistence may not be as regular as
the picture describes, but these simple cases are sufficient to reveal
the challenges of interoperating multiple threading models.

\subsection{Issues with No or Poor Interoperability}
In the use cases for intra-node interoperability, 
the coexistence of multiple user threads and other runtime instances
adds additional level(s) in the overall ``threading''
hierarchy of a program. % Those additional levels could be on top of OpenMP threading mechanism when 
These additional levels of threading increase the complexity of a program for 
users and complicate the reasoning of parallel and synchronization behaviors of parallel tasks. 
More critically, it introduces at least two performance issues
since most OpenMP implementations ignore their existence % user threads or other parallel runtime instance 
in the decision making for runtime scheduling and resource management.

\subsection{Limitation of Interoperability Support in the Standard}
The current OpenMP standard (4.5) provides limited support for users to give hints to runtime for 
better managing OpenMP threads and native threads, which can be used to help reducing 
the impact of oversubscription.
First, the {\sf OMP\_DYNAMIC} group of constructs, which includes the environment variable, 
the {\sf dyn-var} ICV, {\sf omp\_set\_dynamic} and {\sf omp\_get\_dynamic} runtime routine,
indicates the OpenMP implementation to adjust the number of threads to use for executing parallel
regions in order to optimize the use of system resources. 
This approach address only the active oversubscription issue. 
%. OMP\_DYNAMIC could be either
%{\bf true} or {\bf false}. When setting the dynvar ICV to be {\bf true}, user will 

%\paragraph{OMP\_WAIT\_POLICY} %environment variable}
Second, the {\sf ACTIVE} setting for the {\sf OMP\_WAIT\_POLICY} and its associated {\sf wait-policy-var} ICV, 
dictates the waiting thread in sequential region to be actively waiting, which consume processor cycles.
The {\sf PASSIVE} setting allows those threads to yield CPUs for others to use, which addresses the passive 
oversubscription issue. The standard however only allows one time setting of the variable when the program starts, thus 
preventing the dynamic adjustment of thread waiting behavior during the execution. 

Thirdly, the {\sf OMP\_THREAD\_LIMIT} environment, {\sf thread-limit-var} ICV and the {\sf omp\_get\_thread\_limit} getter give users an option to  
 set the maximum number of OpenMP threads to use in a contention group when the program starts, addressing oversubscription issues in certain
 degree. It however does not provide setter to adjust the upper bound of the threads for an OpenMP program during program execution, limiting
 its actually usage in real applications. 
% by setting the threadlimitvar ICV.
%The behavior of the program is implementation defined if the requested value of OMP\_THREAD\_LIMIT is greater than the number of threads an implementation can support

%\subsubsection{Global Impact of Environment Variables}
\input{environmentvariable}


As the combinations of different parallel programming APIs in one application
at different system levels are becoming more
practical solution than creating a single unified and 
comprehensive model, it becomes urgent for OpenMP to enhance its 
interoperability support.
%and to address the two important performance issues with better solutions 
%than what the current standard offers. The proposal in this paper provides 
%solutions to the CPU oversubscription issue and a comprehensive solution is the ongoing effort 
%that will provide an extensible set of interfaces for addressing other interoperability issues. 



%It is important to note that approaches to address those issues are very implementation
%dependent, requiring protocol and agreement in the runtime behavior and/or interfaces 
%of different OpenMP implementations. It may not be realistic to solve some of the issue
%from the language standard, and should be left to users to deal with them. 

%Thus the current standard provide minimum support for interoperability, and it is becoming urgent
%to provide more support for this challenge since
%in the short to medium term. A




 \REM{
%but no getter and setter routine. 
%OMP\_WAIT\_POLICY could be set as either ACTIVE or PASSIVE. 
%The ACTIVE value specifies that waiting threads should mostly be active, consuming processor
% cycles, while waiting. An OpenMP implementation may, for example, make waiting threads spin.
% The PASSIVE value specifies that waiting threads should mostly be passive, not consuming
% processor cycles, while waiting. For example, an OpenMP implementation may make waiting
% threads yield the processor to other threads or go to sleep.
% The details of the ACTIVE and PASSIVE behaviors are implementation defined.
 
 \paragraph{OMP\_THREAD\_LIMIT}
 This also include thread-limit-var ICV and omp\_get\_thread\_limit getter runtime routine.
 The environment variable sets the maximum number of OpenMP threads to use in a contention group by setting the thread-limit-var ICV.
The behavior of the program is implementation defined if the requested value of OMP\_THREAD\_LIMIT is greater than the number of threads an implementation can support

OMP\_DYNAMIC and OMP\_THREAD\_LIMIT are approaches to
addressing active oversubscription, and OMP\_WAIT\_POLICY could be used to address
passive oversubscription. 
Since there are no setters for ICVs for OMP\_WAIT\_POLICY
and OMP\_THREAD\_LIMIT variable in the current standard, 
dynamically changing waiting policy and the maximum number of
threads at runtime is not available.
	
Adding to the complexity is the fact that a user thread may be created 
through a call to a library function whose parallelism (OpenMP) behavior is not known to 
the callee. Typical interoperability issues include the following examples: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Does each user thread use the same OpenMP runtime library or not? 
	If not using the same library, how to handle symbol name 
	conflicts of two more different OpenMP runtime libraries? 
\item For user threads that use the same OpenMP runtime library, does the user threads each create its own runtime instance or they share one?
\item For user threads each of which has its own runtime instance (from the same or 
	different runtime library), how to coordinate the resource management among those
	runtime instances to address such issues as oversubscription and the affinity
	between user threads?
\end{itemize}
