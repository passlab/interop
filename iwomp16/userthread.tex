\textbf{Definition}
A user thread is a thread that is not created by OpenMP implementation. A user thread 
could become an OpenMP initial thread. 

The most common example of user threads are POSIX Threads, 
usually referred to as Pthreads with implementation available on most Unix-like 
POSIX-compliant systems. There are also implementations of other thread libraries, 
for example, Windows Native threads and language based threading support such as 
Java threads or others (e.g. qthreads). 

Figure~\ref{fig:pthread-omp} shows an example of having three user 
threads (two PThreads and one thread of the main program) in an OpenMP program. 
The two three threads execute in parallel after the two PThreads are created. 
Each thread calls a function that will enter into
OpenMP threading parallelism. So they all become OpenMP initial threads. How the 
user threads (PThreads in this example) interact with the OpenMP threading mechanisms
in the runtime is up to the implementation. They may share the same OpenMP runtime
instance or each has its own OpenMP runtime instance.

\subsection{Impacts and Discussions}
A user thread in a program adds additional level(s) in the overall ``threading''
hierarchy of a program. Those additional levels could be on top of OpenMP threading 
mechanism when a user thread becomes an OpenMP initial thread that creates OpenMP thread
parallelism, or beneath the OpenMP threading mechanism when an OpenMP thread spawns 
a user thread, or the the mix of both. In the example from Figure~\ref{fig:pthread-omp}, 
one can view this in a two-level threading parallelism: the top level user thread 
parallelism and the bottom level OpenMP threading parallelism.

These additional levels of threading increase the complexity of a program, both for 
users in the aspect of reasoning the parallel and synchronization behavior of a program, 
and also for the implementation and runtime system in terms of resource management and 
interactions. Adding to the complexity is the facts that a user thread may be created 
through a call to a library function whose paralelism (OpenMP) behavior is not known to 
the callee. Typical issues for example: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Does each user thread use the same OpenMP runtime libraries or not? 
	If not using the same library, how to handle symbol name 
	conflicts of two more different OpenMP runtime libraries. 
\item For user threads that use the same OpenMP runtime library, does the user threads each create its own runtime instance or they share one?
\item For user threads each of which has its own runtime instance (from the same or 
	different runtime library), how to coordinate the resource management among those
	runtime instances to address such issues as oversubscriptions and the affinity
	between user threads?
\end{itemize}

It is important to note that approaches to address those issues are very implementation
dependent, requiring protocol and agreement in the runtime behavior and/or interfaces 
of different OpenMP implementations. It may not be realistic to solve some of the issue
from the language standard, and should be left to users to deal with them. In this
aspect, we still hope this report could provide userful information and practices 
for users.
