OpenMP has become a successful programming model
for developing multithreaded applications.
However, there are still some challenges in terms of OpenMP's interoperability
with itself and other parallel programming models.
In this paper, we explore typical use cases to expose OpenMP's interoperability challenges and
propose a number of solutions.
%which address one of more aspects of OpenMP's interoperability problem.
The solutions we consider include OpenMP's wait policy,
a new runtime feature for quiescing the OpenMP thread pool,
and an OpenMP-based abstraction for general-purpose OS threads.
