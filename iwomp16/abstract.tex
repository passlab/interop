OpenMP has become a successful programming model
for developing multi-threaded applications.
However, there are still some challenges in terms of OpenMP's interoperability
with itself and other parallel programming models.
In this paper, we explore typical use cases to expose OpenMP's interoperability challenges and
propose a number of solutions.
%which address one of more aspects of OpenMP's interoperability problem.
The solutions we propose include several levels of interoperability functionalities of an OpenMP runtime and
the corresponding OpenMP constructs supporting each level.
Ongoing implementation is being done by extending two OpenMP runtime libraries.
Initial results are given for one of the proposed interoperability functionalities 
%, including OpenMP's wait policy,
%a new runtime feature 
for quiescing the OpenMP thread pool to address oversubscription issue. 
%and an OpenMP-based abstraction for general-purpose OS threads.
