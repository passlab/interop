OpenMP has become a very successful programming model
for developing multithreaded applications.
However, there are still some challenges in terms of OpenMP's interoperability
with other threading models.
In this paper, we explore a number of potential solutions to this problem,
which address one of more aspects of OpenMP's interoperability problem.
The solutions we consider include OpenMP's wait policy,
a new runtime feature for quiescing the OpenMP thread pool,
and an OpenMP-based abstraction for general-purpose OS threads.
