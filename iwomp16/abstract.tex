OpenMP has become a very successful user-model for developing parallel applications. 
However, there are still some challenges in terms of OpenMP interoperability. 
In this paper, we introduce some extensions to the OpenMP runtime library related to the interoperability problem. 
We evaluate and compare the performance of the different waiting thread behaviours (PASSIVE \textbar ACTIVE). 
In addition, we introduce a new function to shutdown or unload the whole runtime library,
which enables the greatest degree of interoperability with other threading models.
