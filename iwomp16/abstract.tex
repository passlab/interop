OpenMP has become a successful programming model
for developing multithreaded applications.
However, there are still some challenges in terms of OpenMP's interoperability
with itself and other parallel programming models.
In this paper, we explore typical use cases to expose OpenMP's interoperability challenges and
propose a number of solutions.
%which address one of more aspects of OpenMP's interoperability problem.
The solutions we propose include several levels of interoperability functionalities of an OpenMP runtime and
the corresponding OpenMP constructs supporting each level.
Ongoing implementation is being done by extending Intel OpenMP runtime and GCC OpenMP runtime.
Initial results are given for some of the proposed interoperability functionalities, including OpenMP's wait policy,
a new runtime feature for quiescing the OpenMP thread pool,
and an OpenMP-based abstraction for general-purpose OS threads.
