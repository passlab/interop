OpenMP has become a very successful user-model for developing parallel applications. 
However, there are still some challenges in terms of OpenMP interoperability. 
In this paper, we introduce some extientions to the OpenMP runtime library realted to the interoperability problem. 
Also, we evaluate and compare the performance of the different waiting thread behaviours (PASSIVE \textbar ACTIVE). 
In addition, we introduce a new function to shutdown or unload the whole runtime library when exiting the parallel 
region to prove that It would take longer time than awakening a sleeping thread.
