Hybrid parallel programming in the form of internode+intranode, e.g. MPI+X model are widely used for 
for high-performance computing. This approach reflects the two-level hierarchy of parallelism in current HPC systems, 
in which a high-speed interconnect
joins many highly parallel nodes.
Interoperability between inter-node programming model such as MPI and OpenMP 
systems has long been a productivity and composability goal within
the parallel programming community. We however still have not agreed on a standard solution from either of the two communities.
