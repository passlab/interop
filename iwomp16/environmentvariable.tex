OpenMP's interoperability is also limited by the global scope of 
its environment variables. For example, users cannot set different wait policies for 
multiple concurrent {\sf parallel} regions in nested parallel cases. 
%Currently, the OpenMP specification has an implicit assumption that a 
%single OpenMP program is running on a computation node at any given time.
%So the provided global environment variables should work properly to set the internal control variables that affect the execution
%of the single OpenMP program. 
%However, this causes problem when multiple OpenMP programs are running simultaneously on a computation node. 
%Environment variables affecting resource allocation may uniformly impact all OpenMP programs, which is often not desired.
%For example, unless runtime library routines are explicitly used to customize each program's choices, \lstinline{OMP_NUM_THREADS}, \lstinline{OMP_PROC_BIND}, \lstinline{OMP_DEFAULT_DEVICE} may 
%make all OpenMP runtime instances use the same number of threads, the same affinity, and the same accelerator device, respectively.
